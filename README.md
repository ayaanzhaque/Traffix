High congestion traffic in urban areas is a chronic problem, and travel times are increasingly long. Currently, city planners have no way to analyze what changes they should make to infrastructure in order to minimize cost and maximize a reduction in congestion. Thus, we created Traffix, an application that uses AI to promote smarter road infrastructure design by allowing city planners to interactively optimize road features. We developed an AI model that is trained on traffic data from the government and determines how certain road features such as stop signs, yield signs, traffic lights, lanes, and speed limits can increase the flow of traffic. Through our graphic user interface, city planners can interactively add, remove, or adjust signage to optimize traffic flow in cities. In addition, drivers and contractors can make their suggestions and projects to advertise to the public.
